# Email_Sample_Practice
An email sample from a challenge set by jarrang (participated outside of deadline)

So far i've learnt how to get a basic email layout using tables in html.
I've added some sort of media to change the size depending on screensize but this requires more research.
Also styleing needs work...alot more work
